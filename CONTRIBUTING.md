# How to Contribute

We welcome your contribution. For best effect, please follow our guidelines:

- [Report a Bug](#report-a-bug)
- [Suggest a Feature](#suggest-a-feature)
- [Contribute Code](#contribute-code)

If you need help, please reach out to us by opening an issue.

## Report a Bug 
Before creating a bug report, please check that an [issue](/issues) reporting the same problem does not already exist. 
If there is such an issue, you may add your information as a comment.

To report a new bug you should open an issue that summarizes the bug and ideally includes a minimal reproducible example.

If you want to provide a fix along with your bug report, please send us a pull request. See [Contribute Code](#contribute-code).

## Suggest a Feature
First check if there's already a request for that feature.
If there is and the ticket is open, add a comment rather than creating a new feature.

Otherwise open an [issue](../../issues/new) and write up your idea.

## Contribute Code

1. Ensure you [have the right](http://developercertificate.org).
1. Check if an issue exists for your work. If not, create an [issue](../../issues/new).
1. Fork the repository.
1. Create a branch. If you choose to follow our convention, use a name like 'bug/27_issue_title' where 27 is the bug or feature ID and issue_title is a short version of its title.
1. Open a new *draft* pull request on our project and outline what you will be contributing.
1. Write good [commit messages](#commit-messages).
1. Project maintainers might comment on your work as you progress.
1. When you are done, mark your pull request *ready for review*.

### Commit Messages
Your commit messages ideally can answer two questions: what changed and why. 
The subject line should feature the “what” and the body of the commit should describe the “why”.  

When creating a pull request, its description should reference the corresponding issue id.

#### Sign Your Work / Developer Certificate of Origin
All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1. 
This is exactly the same one created and used by the Linux kernel developers and posted on http://developercertificate.org/.
This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project. 
Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however, please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in every patch (this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO). 
You can automate this with a [Git hook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15015894/git-add-signed-off-by-line-using-format-signoff-not-working)
